excerpt: In the formal language theory of computer science, left recursion is a special case of recursion where a string is recognized as part of a language by the fact that it decomposes into a string from that same language (on the left) and a suffix (on the right). For instance, 1+2+3 can be recognized as a sum because it can be broken into 1+2, also a sum, and +3, a suitable suffix
