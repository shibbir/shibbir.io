At first, Install scim package through Synaptic Package Manager.

Then download & install:

```text
http://scim-avro.googlecode.com/files/scim-avro_0.0.2-1ubuntu9.10_i386.deb
```

Now, make scim your default input method:

* Open terminal and type: `im-switch -c`
* Watch the number beside scim, type it and press Enter.
* log off and log in again from your system

Now press `Ctrl+space` for switch between Bangla & English

Happy Typing...
