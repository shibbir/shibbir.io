[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is a cross-platform task runner for web development. When working on javascript projects, quite often we have to do some repetitive tasks such as minifying the CSS or javascript, concatenating them into one file to reduce the HTTP round trip between server to the client browser, optimizing images, running the tests, etc. Depending on the size of the projects, managing those tasks can be very time consuming and tedious. But with the help of a task runner, you can automate this whole process and just focus on the application.

## Installing Gulp

Gulp is based on Node.js. Which means you have to download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org). Go ahead and do that if you haven't already. Now before installing gulp in your project you need to install the
gulp command-line utility. [This article](https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467) explains why you need to install `gulp-cli`.

```bash
$ npm install gulp-cli --global
```

Now we are ready to install gulp. The following commands will create a **_package.json_** file with default configs, install gulp as your development dependency, and display the versions:

```bash
$ npm init --yes
$ npm install gulp --save-dev
$ gulp --version
```

## Gulp api's

Gulp exposes several api's to work. The most commons are:

`src(globs, [options])`: Accepts a glob which is a string array and returns a stream that produces Vinyl objects. Vinyl is a metadata object that describes a file.

`dest(directory, [options])`: The path of the output directory where files will be written.

`series(...tasks)`: Combines task functions and/or composed operations into larger operations that will be executed one after another, in sequential order.

`parallel(...tasks)`: Combines task functions and/or composed operations into larger operations that will be executed simultaneously.

`watch(globs, [options], [task])`: Allows watching globs and running a task when a change occurs.

## Gulpfile

Create a **_gulpfile.js_** or **_Gulpfile.js_** file in the root directory that automatically loads when you run the `gulp` command. The syntax for gulp is `gulp <task> <othertask>`. Any exported functions from **_gulpfile.js_** will be registered
into gulp's task system. These functions are asynchronous that can return streams, promises, event emitters, child processes, or observables.

```javascript
function defaultTask(cb) {
    console.log("This is the default task.");
    cb();
}

function otherTask(cb) {
    console.log("Tell me what to do!");
    cb();
}

exports.default = defaultTask;
exports.otherTask = otherTask;
```

Now if you run the following commands one by one; the first one will execute the `defaultTask` function or _task_ beacuse it is exported as default and the second command will execute the `otherTask` task:
```bash
$ gulp
$ gulp otherTask
```

You can combines task functions and/or composed operations into larger operations using `series()` and `parallel()`.

```javascript
const { series, parallel } = require("gulp");

function css(done) {
    // body omitted
    done();
}

function javascript(done) {
    // body omitted
    done();
}

exports.sequentialBuild = series(javascript, css);
exports.simultaneousBuild = parallel(javascript, css);
```

## Using Plugins

Gulp plugins are small utility libraries that encapsulate common functionality to transform files in a pipeline. You can use multiple plugins in a single task. Plugins are a great way to reuse functionality from different
places in Gulpfile. Currently, there are 3807 plugins available and the list is still growing. You can use plugins to do things like CSS minification, concatenating javascript, running server, etc. Let's look at some
examples of such things using gulp:

#### Example #1: Sass compilation and css minification

```bash
$ npm install node-sass gulp-sass gulp-clean-css --save-dev
```

```javascript
const { src, dest } = require("gulp");
const sass = require("gulp-sass");
const cleanCSS = require("gulp-clean-css");
sass.compiler = require("node-sass");

function css(done) {
    src("./style.scss")
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(cleanCSS())
        .pipe(dest("./output"));
    done();
}

exports.css = css;

```

First, we brought in the required libraries. Then, we created a task called `style`. Inside that task, we told gulp what is the file path for our scss file using `src` api. Then we compile it down to CSS using the `sass()` method that
[gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) plugin provides. After that, we minified the compiled CSS file. Finally, we specified the destination for our output file. You can see that we can chain methods together to describe our tasks.

#### Example #2: TypeScript to JavaScript compilation

```bash
$ npm install typescript gulp-typescript --save-dev
```

```javascript
const { src, dest } = require("gulp");
const ts = require("gulp-typescript");

function typescript(done) {
    src("./script.ts")
        .pipe(ts())
        .pipe(dest("./output"));
    done();
}

exports.typescript = typescript;

```

#### Example #3: JavaScript minification

```bash
$ npm install gulp-uglify-es --save-dev
```

```javascript
const { src, dest } = require("gulp");
const uglify = require("gulp-uglify-es").default;

function compress(done) {
    src("./scripts.js")
        .pipe(uglify())
        .pipe(dest("./output"));
    done();
}

exports.compress = compress;

```

## Watching source files

You can also [watch](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/watching-files) for changes so that you donâ€™t have to manually run gulp each time your source files change. lets create a task for that:

```javascript
const { watch } = require("gulp");

function css(done) {
    // body omitted
    done();
}

function javascript(done) {
    // body omitted
    done();
}

function watcher() {
    watch("./style.css", css);
    watch("./script.js", javascript);
}

exports.watcher = watcher;

```
Now simply running `gulp watcher` will watch for changes in the specified files and automatically trigger the corresponding task.

## All together
Lets put all of the above examples together to create a final example.

First, download the necessary packages for this particular scenario:

```bash
$ npm install gulp node-sass typescript gulp-sass gulp-typescript gulp-rename gulp-clean-css gulp-uglify-es --save-dev
```

Lets edit the gulpfile.js:

```javascript
const { src, dest, watch, parallel } = require("gulp");
const sass = require("gulp-sass");
const ts = require("gulp-typescript");
const rename = require("gulp-rename");
const cleanCSS = require("gulp-clean-css");
const uglify = require("gulp-uglify-es").default;

sass.compiler = require("node-sass");

function css(done) {
    src("./style.scss")
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(rename("bundle.css"))
        .pipe(dest("./output"))
        .pipe(cleanCSS())
        .pipe(rename("bundle.min.css"))
        .pipe(dest("./output"));
    done();
}

function typescript(done) {
    src("./script.ts")
        .pipe(ts())
        .pipe(rename("bundle.js"))
        .pipe(dest("./output"))
        .pipe(uglify())
        .pipe(rename("bundle.min.js"))
        .pipe(dest("./output"));
    done();
}

function watcher() {
    watch("./style.css", css);
    watch("./script.ts", typescript);
}

exports.watcher = watcher;
exports.build = parallel(css, typescript);

```

```bash
$ gulp watcher // listen for changes
$ gulp build // execute css and javascript tasks simultaneously
```

## Wrap up

Easy, right? Although we've gone through only the basics of Gulp. Gulp can do much more than this and can be very complex or very simple depending on the project. Here are some important points to remember:
* Each gulp task is an asynchronous JavaScript function. Synchronous tasks aren't supported, though there is a [alternative](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/async-completion#using-async-await).
* Tasks can be considered public or private. Public tasks are exported from your gulpfile. Private tasks are made to be used internally.
* If your gulpfile becomes too big, you can split each task into its own file. More on [here](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#splitting-a-gulpfile).
* You can write a gulpfile using TypeScript or Babel. For TypeScript, rename to `gulpfile.ts`, and for Babel, rename to `gulpfile.babel.js`. More on [here](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#transpilation).
